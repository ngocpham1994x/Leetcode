/*
Given an array consists of integers (ex. [1,2,3,1,2,3,3,3]),
the required returning value is the length of longest substring
that consists of repeating integer value you can get with maximum 3 replacements
(and you can replace any item with any value).

Test cases:

Input: A = [1,2,3,1,2,3,3,3]
Output: 6
Replace A[1], A[3], A[4] with 3 (3 moves)

Input: A = [1,2,7,8,3,45]
Output: 4
Pick any item and replace 3 items adjacent to that item with the value of the picked item.
